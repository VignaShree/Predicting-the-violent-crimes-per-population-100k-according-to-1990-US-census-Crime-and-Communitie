# Predicting-the-violent-crimes-per-population-100k-according-to-1990-US-census-Crime-and-Communities
The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR. The dataset contains 2216 records and 147 attributes. The main aim was to predict what factors contribute to violent crimes in society. Performed data transformation, found the outliers in the attributes using box plot, skewness using barplot, and handled the extremities in the data by box cox transformation. Applied Principal Component Analysis to find the most correlated variables that have a high impact on the target value. Applied Machine Learning Models like linear regression, lasso regression, regression trees, and random forest.
